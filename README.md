I2C is a communication protocol used to connect sensors and peripherals to microcontrollers

Serial Data (SDA) The data line — sends/receives data between the microcontroller and sensor

Serial Clock (SCL) The clock line — keeps everything in sync by pulsing with timing signals

boost converters convert a low voltage to a higher (regulated) voltage

buck converters convert a high voltage to a lower (regulated) voltage

buck-boost converters can convert any voltage (based on specific circuit limitations) to a specified regulated voltage

LDO's or linear dropout regulators convert a high voltage to a lower voltage, the voltage difference is dissipated via heat
